Instructions:

Create "Wildland Fires Video Player" application for Windows built in the Unity Game Engine, written in C#.

The provided videos should be used to populate the library.

Features
-App launches to main menu allowing the user to select a video to play
-Each video is presented with a unique title and description
-Selecting a video pulls up a video screen with industry standard video controls:
	-Play/Pause
	-Scrubbable Timeline
	-Mute Button
	-Home Button to return to library

Evaluation:
1) Accurate and reliable functionality will be given the most consideration.
2) Efficient, intuitive, and well commented code will be evaluated heavily.
3) Finally, this is not a test on graphic design and any work on improving the UI should be a last priority after the first 2 points. 

Submit a link to the completed project and Win64 build on github or other hosting site by the date listed in the test email.
